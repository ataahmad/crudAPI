# crudAPI
Familiarizing myself with node, express and other tools by building a basic CRUD API.
This is a folder that I saved all of my work in. The way it is currently written is that it sets up the CRUD on your machine's localhost port 5000.
The next steps I will take are to connect a dtaatbase to it, probably using MongoDB.
For now, there is no database, it just creates a temporary array while the server is running. All info is lost after the server stops.
